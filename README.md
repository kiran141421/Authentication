# Authentication

## Introduction
This Node.js project is built to demonstrate the implementation of OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and various other security measures. It provides a secure login system using OAuth 2.0, ensuring user authentication and protecting sensitive information.

## Features
- OAuth 2.0 login system: Allows users to log in using their existing OAuth 2.0 credentials from providers such as Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.
- Secure session management: Utilizes session management techniques to ensure secure user sessions and prevent session hijacking.
- Password encryption: Implements secure password encryption to protect user passwords from unauthorized access.
- Input validation: Utilizes input validation techniques to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Rate limiting: Implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks and protect against excessive API requests.
- Error handling: Includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages and prevent information leakage.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kiran141421/Authentication.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd your-file`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Configuration
Before running the project, you need to configure the following:

1. OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
   - Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials from your desired provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).
   - Set up your provider's credentials in the project configuration file (e.g., `config.js`).
   
2. Database Configuration:
   - Configure your database connection details in the project configuration file (e.g., `config.js`).
   - Set up the required tables/schema in your database.

3. Other Configuration Options:
   - Review and modify other configuration options in the project configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) as per your requirements.

## Usage
1. Start the server: `node app.js` 
2. Access the application in your web browser: `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port)
